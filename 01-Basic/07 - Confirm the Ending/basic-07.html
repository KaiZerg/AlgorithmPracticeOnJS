	<h1>Confirm the ending</h1>
	<p>Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argument, target).
	This challenge can be solved with the .endsWith() method, which was introduced in ES2015. But for the
	purpose of this challenge, we would like you to use one of the JavaScript substring methods instead.

	</p>
	<h3>Type in commands below into browser console, to see the result:</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li>confirmEnding("Bastian", "n") should return true.</li>
	    <li>confirmEnding("Connor", "n") should return false.</li>
	    <li>confirmEnding("Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen", "specification") should return false.</li>
	    <li>confirmEnding("He has to give me a new name", "name") should return true.</li>
 	    <li>confirmEnding("Open sesame", "same") should return true.</li>
	    <li>Do not use the built-in method .endsWith() to solve the challenge.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>My solution:</h3>
  	<blockquote><p>
	function confirmEnding(str, target) {<br>
  	&nbsp; &nbsp; var check = str.substring(str.length - target.length);<br>
  	&nbsp; &nbsp; return check == target;<br>
	}
	</p>

	<h2>What did i learn?</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li>The <strong>substring()</strong> method returns a subset of a string between one index and another, or through the end of the string.</li>
	    <li>Where the arguments of the <strong>substring()</strong> method represent the starting and ending indexes, the arguments of <strong>substr()</strong> method represent the starting index and the length of characters to include in the resulting string.</li>
	    <li>Example uses the substring() method and length property to extract the last characters of a particular string. This method may be easier to remember, given that you don't need to know the starting and ending indices</li>

	</ul>
